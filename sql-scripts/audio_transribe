/*
The provided query is designed to perform the following tasks:
Create an object table named customer_review_audio in the fashion_data dataset. This BigLake table will be used to store audio files from Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Create a connection to Vertex AI named VertexAI-Ext in US region; details in this link https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection
Create a model named speech_to_text in the fashion_data dataset. This model will be used to transcribe the audio files into text.

Use the ML.TRANSCRIBE function to transcribe the audio files in the customer_review_audio table. The results of the transcription will be stored in a  table named customer_review_transcribe.

Update the review_text column in the customer_review table with the transcribed text from the customer_review_transcribe table.
